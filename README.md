# Final Project: Palindromic Number Guessing Game
Hello, welcome to our game. Here is a step-by-step guide to what it does.

#Project Description

The Palindromic Number Guessing Game offers users an engaging and unique twist on the classic number guessing game. In this game, players are tasked with guessing a randomly generated palindromic number within a specified range. A palindromic number reads the same backward as it does forward, such as 121 or 1331. This adds an extra layer of challenge and intrigue to the gameplay.

The reason why this guessing game is programmed with palindromic numbers is because we have tried many times yet not achieved one single time with normal integers. That is why we decided to give different approach to let the players have fun with it instead of getting bored.

#Features

-Random number generation within a specified range

-Limited number of attempts to guess the number

-Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low

-Hint on the first digit

#Where to start

As soon as you run the code, the game will start immediately and let you know that it has a secret number within a certain range. And you will have to guess it by adding input; you have limited attempts (only 10). 
When asked for input, you must enter a valid number; otherwise, a TypeError can prevent you from doing so.

Once you have entered your guess, the game will return the hint to go either lower or higher than what you have guessed. Easy, right? 

You will win if you can guess the right number in the limited attempts; otherwise, the game will be over with you being a loser! HAHA 

The hints include 'l', which means the player's guess is low, 'h', which means high, and 'e', which means equal. Also, we added another hint system that lets you know whether the first digit of your guess is correct or not. Easy, right? Good luck!
