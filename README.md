# Final Project: Number Guessing Game
Hello, welcome to our game. Here is a step-by-step guide to what it does.

#Project Description

The Number Guessing Game is a Python program that enables users to play a fun number-guessing challenge. The game randomly generates a number within a specified range, and the user must guess this number within a limited number of attempts. Additionally, the game features a reverse guessing mode where the computer attempts to guess the user's chosen number using a binary search algorithm. The program employs various data structures and algorithms to create an engaging and efficient gaming experience.

#Features

-Random number generation within a specified range

-Limited number of attempts to guess the number

-Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low

-Reverse guessing mode where the computer tries to guess the user's number

-User statistics tracking and display

#Where to start

As soon as you run the code, the game will start immediately and let you know that it has a secret number within a certain range. And you will have to guess it by adding input; you have limited attempts (only 10). 
When asked for input, you must enter a valid number; otherwise, a TypeError can prevent you from doing so.

Once you have entered your guess, the game will return the hint to go either lower or higher than what you have guessed. Easy, right? 

You will win if you can guess the right number in the limited attempts; otherwise, the game will be over with you being a loser! HAHA

Just kidding, you will have the chance to play it again if you want to take revenge. Or you can also let the computer taste a bit of its own medicine.
You will take the lead and think of a secret number in your mind, and let the computer guess within a limited attempts, just like it did to you. Fun, right? 

We call it 'reverse_guess_game', where you become an initiator and the computer becomes a player. Just like that, don't forget to give hints though. You can't type any other words than the symbols provided.
'l' means the player's guess is low, 'h' for high, 'e' for equal. We allow a little bit of dirty playing where you don't let the computer win. Why? Because you can (we are on your side).

After taking revenge, you can quit or play again. And that's all. Good luck!
